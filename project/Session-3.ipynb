The channel can be described by a channel matrix $\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n_R \\times n_T}$, whose coefficient $\\tilde{h}_{ij}$ is the complex channel coefficient between transmitter antenna $i$ and receiver antenna $j$. Such channel coefficient can include the path loss, shadowing, and fading. To begin, the shadowing will not be considered.\n",

Either a unique communication stream is considered between one emitter and one receiver, and the multiple antennes enable to improve the S(I)NR of the transmission. This is what will be referred to as **beamforming** techniques. When both the emitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple antennas, then it is also possible to send multiple communication streams simultaneously, on the different antennas. This process is named **multiplexing**. In this session, only the beamforming techniques will be considered. \n",
