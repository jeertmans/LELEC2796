    "Let's first focus on the channel modelling problem, between an emitter equipped with $n_T$ antennas and a receiver with $n_R$ antennas. The channel can be described by a channel matrix $\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n_R \\times n_T}$, whose coefficient $\\tilde{h}_{ij}$ is the complex channel coefficient between transmitter antenna $i$ and receiver antenna $j$. Such channel coefficient can include the path loss, shadowing, and fading. To begin, the shadowing will not be considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal distance $d$ between the emitter and the receiver is usually much greater than the dimension of the antenna arrays, and thus the path loss can be considered constant across all antenna pairs. Therefore, the channel model becomes\n",

    "$$ L(d) = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\sqrt{h^2+r^2}\\right)^{\\alpha}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the fading, many random models can be considered to model $\\mathbf{H}$. All these models must nevertheless be such that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|h_{ij}\\right|^2\\right] =1$ whatever $i$ and $j$, by definition of the fading. In this session, two basic channel models will be considered. \n",

    "\n",

    "Thanks to the use of multiple antennas and the emitter, and the receiver, the communication can be improved. Two mains direction can be considered for such improvement. Either a unique communication stream is considered between one emitter and one receiver, and the multiple antennes enable to improve the S(i)NR of the transmission. This is what will be named the **beamforming** techniques. When both the emitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple antennas, then it is also possible to send multiple communication streams simultaneously, on the different antennas. This process is named **multiplexing**. In this session, only the beamforming techniques will be considered. \n",

    "The received power, in itself, is not sufficient to characterise the communication quality. One can instead assess the SINR of the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "To that aim, one must evaluate the power received from the other BS, which also beamform towards another user. One possibility to do so would be to consider two PPPs (one for the BS and one for the users), to associate the users with the BSs and them to compute the MRT beamforming vector for each BS. Yes, problems arise as some BSs can be associated with no user, and some might have several users to serve. \n",
    "\n",
    "As anyway the users locations are uniform, an alternative way to evaluate the interference is consider only one PPP for the BSs. The BS closest to the origin performs MRT beamformin towards the user located at the origin. It is assumed all other BS serves a unique user. Since the beamforming only depends on the fading channel matrix between the BS and the user it serves, such channel matrix can be draw randomly and the beamforming vectors of all BS can be computed. Then, the interference can be evaluated. "
