    "# Session 1: introduction to point processes\n",
    "\n",
    "When studying wireless communications, the performance of the employed communication schemes is often measured as an averaged quantity, such as the average throughput, or the Bit Error Rate (BER). To compute the average BER on a static channel, the noise realisations should be averaged out. Fading could also comes into play, in which case the error probability is averaged on both the noise and channel realisations. Moreover, it is also possible to consider the slow time channel variations, i.e., the shadowing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these three cases (noise, fading, shadowing), the average quantity can either be determined analytically through Probability Density Functions (PDFs) integration, or through numerical simulations. In these latter, the followed approach is to draw samples of the random quantities, evaluate the performance for each sample draw, and then to take the average of the performances. This approach is named a **Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, only the random quantities affecting a single point-to-point link have been discussed. Yet, to study the averaged link quality a user faces in the network, it is important to also consider the spatial distribution of a network as a random quantity. This approach, named **stochastic geometry**, can also be performed either analytically, or by means of Monte-Carlo methods.\n",
